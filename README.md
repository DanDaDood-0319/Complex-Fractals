# ****Complex Fractals****
This is [DanDaDood-0319](https://github.com/DanDaDood-0319)'s fractal renderer. As you see here, currently, it sucks. This is my second project with [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/), so please don't cringe.

This is a complex fractal renderer. It renders complex fractals, such as the mandelbrot set.
