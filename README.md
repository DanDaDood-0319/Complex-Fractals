# ****Complex Fractals****
This is [DanDaDood-0319](https://github.com/DanDaDood-0319)'s [complex fractal]() renderer.

## Dependencies
This requires [Python](http://python.org/) *(duh)* as well as the following libraries:
* **math** for... well, math! *(comes with a generic installation of [Python](http://python.org/))*installation of [Python](http://python.org/))*
* **[colorsys]()** for converting HSV into RGB for the coloring.
* **[pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)** for rendering.

## Personal Notes
* This is my second project with **[PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/)** and **[TkInter]()**! *(TkInter not implemented yet)*
  * *(also my first README.md file!)* 
* Expect it to suck, because I'm not that good at programming This is just. Also, as you have noticed, this is *very*, ***very*** informal.
* I don't expect anyone to see this, but if you do, then **hi**!
